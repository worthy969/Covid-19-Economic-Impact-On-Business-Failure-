#### Introduction 
The number of business failures fell sharply during the Covid crisis. Public support prevented many companies from going bankrupt, particularly the smallest and those in the sectors most affected by the crisis. However,an analysis of the companies that failed shows that the market selection continued to play a role, with the most fragile companies continuing to enter into legal proceedings during the crisis. <br> French government support for businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic induced economic crisis helped avert a wave of bankruptcies. in 2020, support measures led to a record-breaking year-on-year drop in the number of business failures (i.e.court-ordered reorganizations or liquidations), with 31,000 recorded that year, compared to 50,000 in 2019. This trend continued in 2021, with a total of 40,000 bankruptcies "avoided" from March 2020 to October 2021, or a 45% decline compared to the equivalent pre-pandemic period. <br> Business failures are a critical economic indicator, reflecting financial health, policy effectiveness, and external disruptions. This report examines failure trends across:
* Time periods (pre-pandemic, pandemic, post-pandemic 2014-2024).
* Regional Variations (Most affected vs. least affected regions).
* Seasonal patterns (Quarterly trends).
The goal is to provide **actionable insights for policymakers,business, and investors**.
### Key insights 
1. Did failure spike, remain stable, or decrease after COVID-19?
2. Did Businesses bounce back after COVID-19 or are failure still rising?
3. Which regions suffered the most and which bounced back the fastest?
4. Are there Seasonal patterns where failures spike in certain months?
# Summary of Findings And Recommendations
